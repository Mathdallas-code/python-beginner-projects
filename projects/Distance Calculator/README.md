<h1 style="text-align: center">Distance Calculator</h1>
This is a distance calculator made using Python. It can calculate the distance between two points on a 2D plane.

## How to use

`python3 distance_calculator.py`

There are two functions, `main()` and `calculate_distance()`

By default, if you run the project it runs the `main()` function.
You can download the file to use it as a module.

## Other

I am planning to make a PyPI package of it soon.

You can view it's repository [here](https://github.com/Mathdallas-code/Distance-Calculator)
